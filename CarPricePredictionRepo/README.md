                        Car Price Prediction Project

With the covid 19 impact in the market, we have seen lot of changes in the car market. Now some cars are in demand hence making them costly and some are not in demand hence cheaper. 
One of our clients works with small traders, who sell used cars. With the change in market due to covid 19 impact, our client is facing problems with their previous car price valuation machine learning models. So, they are looking for new machine learning models from new data. 

Project phases:
1. Data Collection Phase:
    -Scraped 5000+ used cars data from Olx, Cardekho and Cars24 websites.
    -Used Selenium webdriver to scrape the required data.
    -The columns scraped are Brand, model, variant, manufacturing year, driven kilometers, fuel, number of owners, location and at the last target variable Price of the car.
    -Included all types of cars in your data for example- SUV, Sedans, Coupe, minivan, Hatchback.
2. Model Building phase:
    -Data cleaning is performed.
    -EDA is performed.
    -Data preprocessing is performed.
    -Different models are built and compared with evaluation metrics to identify the suitable model.
3. MLOPS:
    -Created project template using cookie cutter.
